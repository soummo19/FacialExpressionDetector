# FacialExpressionDetector

It is basically an Web Based App to detect the Universal Seven Facial Expression.
The data set used here if of a Kaggle Competition with the same topic.
I have developed this application with the help of Mr. Snehan Kekre as my instructor.

To implement this-
1. Clone it to your local desktop
2. Make sure you have all the requirements installed in your system 
   which is given in the requirements.txt file
3. When you have all the requirements installed 
    run main.py
    
    Enjoy :-)
